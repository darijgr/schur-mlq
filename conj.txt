Current conjecture:

The MLQ generating function equals

product of x_{b_i} over all i

times

product of e_{k_j}(x_1, ..., x_N) over all j

times

determinant of h_{j - k_{n+1-i}(S)'} (x_1, ..., x_{b_{n+1-i}}) over
all 1 <= i <= n and all 1 <= j <= n.

This is the same as the flagged Schur function for (straight) shape
\lambda with \lambda_i = n+1-i - k_i(S)' and for flagging b_n,
b_{n-1}, ..., b_1.
